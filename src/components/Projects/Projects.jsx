// Secure Transactions: Funds are held in escrow until delivery is confirmed, ensuring safety for both sides.

// Build Relationships: Verified profiles and review systems foster trust for repeat partnerships.

// Why It Matters:

// For Farmers:

// Reach broader markets beyond local middlemen.

// Set flexible pricing and negotiate bulk sales.

// Reduce post-harvest waste with timely connections.

// For Buyers:

// Access fresh, traceable produce at fair rates.

// Customize orders (bulk, seasonal) through direct chats.

// Support sustainable farming communities.

// Innovative Features:

// Smart Alerts: Buyers receive notifications for preferred crops.

// Delivery Tracking: Real-time updates from farm to doorstep.

// AI Insights: Farmers get pricing tips based on market trends.

// Impact Beyond Trade:
// By shortening supply chains, Product Connect cuts carbon footprints, boosts farmer incomes, and ensures fresher food for buyers. Join a movement that’s transforming agriculture—one direct deal at a time.
